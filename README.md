## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure **Python 3** is installed.

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tara32473/python-calculator.git

2.	Navigate into the project folder:
cd python-calculator

3.	Run the calculator:
python calculator.py

🧠 How It Works
	•	All operations are handled inside the Calculator class.
	•	User is presented with a simple menu.
	•	Program validates input to prevent crashes.
	•	Loops until the user selects Exit.

📘 Code Example
calc = Calculator()
result = calc.multiply(7, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 21

💡 Future Improvements
	•	GUI version using Tkinter
	•	Support for advanced math functions
	•	Calculation history
	•	Unit tests with pytest
	•	Colorized terminal output
